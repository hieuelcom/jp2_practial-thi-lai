The Airline Reservation System (ARS) is a software application to assist an airline with transactions
related to making ticket reservations, which includes blocking, reserving, canceling and rescheduling
tickets. You as a developer, you need to perform following tasks:

boolean add(E o) Adds the specified element to this queue.
void clear() Atomically removes all of the elements from this queue.
E peek() Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, returning null if this queue is empty.
E poll() Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or null if this queue is empty.
void put(E o) Adds the specified element to this priority queue.
boolean remove(Object o) Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue, if it is present.
